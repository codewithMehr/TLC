          TLC Training is focused on working with handlers that wish to train
          their own dogs to become certified assistance dogs. The primary
          trainer is the owner and we provide one-on-one training to help teams
          achieve success on the Government of Alberta public access test for
          certification.

          At this time, TLC Training is servicing the Calgary, Alberta area. Our
          target client at this time will already have a dog that has completed
          basic obedience training at a minimum. We do not provide dogs, nor do
          we provide classes for basic obedience. We would be happy to refer you
          to excellent training facilities in the Calgary area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Costs for services are dependent on current funding available from
          government grants and/or client annual income.
